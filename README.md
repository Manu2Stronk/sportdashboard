Webprog Project Readme
To use our website it is necessary to have node installed.
The packages are in the github folder, because of this you don't need to
download the packages "conncet" and "serve-Static"

To run the webpage you have to open the terminal and change the folder to the place you
downloaded the project.
Then you start the server by typing in "node server.js"
You can access the website via localhost by the following link
http://localhost:8080/
The port we are using is 8080.
